CISSP Domain 7: Security Operations

1. Foundational Concepts
Security Operations Management: Overseeing the day-to-day operations that protect an organization's information assets, including incident response, monitoring, and maintenance of security controls.
Operational Resilience: Ensuring that the organization can maintain essential functions during and after a disruptive event, such as a cyber attack, natural disaster, or system failure.
Least Privilege Principle: Applying the principle of least privilege to limit access to the minimum level necessary for users to perform their job functions, reducing the risk of insider threats.

2. Incident Management
Incident Response Planning: Developing and maintaining an incident response plan (IRP) that outlines procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents.
Incident Detection and Analysis: Monitoring systems for indicators of compromise (IOCs), investigating anomalies, and analyzing incidents to determine their nature and scope.
Incident Response: Coordinating and executing the incident response process, including containment, eradication, recovery, and communication with stakeholders.
Post-Incident Activities: Conducting post-incident reviews to analyze the root causes of incidents, lessons learned, and implementing improvements to prevent recurrence.

3. Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity Planning (BCP)
Business Impact Analysis (BIA): Identifying critical business functions, dependencies, and potential impacts of disruptions to prioritize recovery efforts.
Disaster Recovery Planning: Developing and testing DR plans to ensure that critical IT systems can be restored quickly after a disruption.
Business Continuity Planning: Creating and maintaining a BCP that ensures the organization can continue operations during and after a significant disruption.
Backup and Recovery: Implementing backup solutions and procedures to ensure data integrity and availability in the event of a system failure or data loss.

4. Log Management and Monitoring
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): Using SIEM tools to collect, correlate, and analyze logs from various sources to detect and respond to security events in real-time.
Log Retention and Protection: Establishing policies for log retention, ensuring that logs are stored securely, and are protected from tampering or unauthorized access.
Monitoring and Alerting: Continuously monitoring systems for security events, and configuring alerts to notify the appropriate personnel of potential incidents.

5. Resource Protection Techniques
Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Implementing DLP solutions to monitor, detect, and prevent the unauthorized transfer of sensitive information outside the organization.
Media Management: Managing the lifecycle of media (e.g., hard drives, tapes) that store sensitive data, ensuring proper labeling, handling, and secure disposal.
Secure Disposal: Ensuring that data is securely erased or destroyed when no longer needed, using methods like degaussing, shredding, or incineration.

6. Access Control Monitoring
Identity and Access Management (IAM) Monitoring: Regularly reviewing access control policies, user roles, and permissions to ensure compliance with the principle of least privilege.
Privileged Account Management (PAM): Monitoring and controlling the use of privileged accounts to prevent abuse and unauthorized access.
Continuous Monitoring: Implementing continuous monitoring of user activities, access patterns, and systems to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts.

7. Patch and Vulnerability Management
Patch Management: Regularly applying security patches and updates to systems and applications to address known vulnerabilities and reduce the attack surface.
Vulnerability Management: Conducting regular vulnerability scans, assessments, and remediation efforts to identify and mitigate potential security weaknesses.
Configuration Management: Ensuring that systems are securely configured according to established baselines, and continuously monitoring for deviations from these configurations.

8. Change and Configuration Management
Change Management Process: Implementing a formal process for managing changes to IT systems, including documentation, testing, approval, and communication of changes.
Configuration Management Database (CMDB): Maintaining a CMDB to track the configuration and relationships of all IT assets, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information is available for decision-making.
Change Control Board (CCB): Establishing a CCB to review and approve proposed changes, ensuring that changes are evaluated for security risks before implementation.

9. Physical Security Operations
Physical Access Controls: Implementing physical security measures, such as locks, badges, biometric scanners, and security guards, to protect facilities and sensitive areas from unauthorized access.
Environmental Controls: Ensuring that environmental controls (e.g., HVAC, fire suppression, power supply) are in place and functioning properly to protect IT infrastructure from physical damage.
Surveillance and Monitoring: Using video surveillance, motion detectors, and alarms to monitor and protect physical assets, ensuring quick detection and response to security incidents.

10. Security Awareness and Training
Security Training Programs: Developing and delivering training programs to educate employees about security policies, procedures, and best practices.
Phishing Simulations: Conducting regular phishing simulations to test employees' awareness and response to phishing attacks, and providing targeted training based on results.
Awareness Campaigns: Running security awareness campaigns to keep security top-of-mind for all employees, using posters, newsletters, and interactive sessions.

11. Investigations and Forensics
Digital Forensics: Collecting, preserving, and analyzing digital evidence following an incident, ensuring the integrity and admissibility of evidence for legal proceedings.
Chain of Custody: Maintaining a strict chain of custody for all evidence collected during investigations to ensure it remains unaltered and is handled properly.
Legal and Regulatory Compliance: Ensuring that all investigations comply with relevant laws and regulations, and that the organization is prepared to respond to legal requests for information.
