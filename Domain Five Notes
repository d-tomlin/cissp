CISSP Domain 5: Identity and Access Management (IAM)

1. Identification and Authentication
Identification: Establishing a unique identity for users, systems, or devices to distinguish them within the environment.
Authentication Methods: Implementing various authentication techniques to verify identity, including:
Something You Know: Passwords, PINs, security questions.
Something You Have: Smart cards, tokens, one-time passwords (OTPs).
Something You Are: Biometrics (fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans).
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Combining two or more authentication factors for enhanced security.

2. Identity as a Service (IDaaS)
Cloud-Based IAM: Utilizing cloud-based identity and access management solutions that provide centralized identity management, authentication, and authorization services.
Federated Identity Management: Implementing systems that allow users to maintain a single identity across multiple organizations or services (e.g., SAML, OAuth, OpenID Connect).

3. Access Control Models
Discretionary Access Control (DAC): Allowing data owners to control access to their resources based on user identity.
Mandatory Access Control (MAC): Enforcing access controls based on predefined security labels and classifications, typically used in high-security environments.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assigning access permissions based on user roles within the organization, simplifying management and ensuring that users only have the access they need.
Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): Making access decisions based on attributes (e.g., user role, location, time, device type) rather than just roles or identities.

4. Access Control Techniques
Access Control Lists (ACLs): Defining which users or systems are allowed to access certain resources and what actions they can perform.
Capability Tables: Associating each user with a list of resources they are allowed to access and the operations they can perform.
Physical Access Controls: Implementing physical security measures such as badges, biometric readers, and access control systems to restrict entry to sensitive areas.

5. Identity Management Lifecycle
Provisioning and Deprovisioning: Managing the creation, modification, and deletion of user identities and access rights throughout the identity lifecycle.
Identity Proofing: Verifying the authenticity of a userâ€™s identity during the initial identity creation process.
Credential Management: Managing the issuance, renewal, and revocation of authentication credentials (e.g., passwords, digital certificates, smart cards).

6. Authentication Management
Password Management: Implementing policies for strong password creation, storage, and regular updates to reduce the risk of password-related attacks.
Biometric Systems: Using biometric technology for authentication, balancing security with privacy and usability considerations.
Single Sign-On (SSO): Allowing users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple systems without needing to log in again, enhancing user experience and reducing password fatigue.

7. Authorization Mechanisms
Access Reviews and Audits: Conducting regular reviews and audits of access controls to ensure they align with organizational policies and that only authorized users have access to resources.
Least Privilege: Granting users the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job functions, reducing the potential impact of insider threats or compromised accounts.
Separation of Duties: Implementing controls to ensure that no single individual has enough access to perform critical tasks alone, reducing the risk of fraud or error.

8. Directory Services
LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol): Utilizing directory services for centralized management of user information and authentication (e.g., Active Directory).
Kerberos: Implementing the Kerberos protocol for secure, ticket-based authentication in distributed environments.
RADIUS and TACACS+: Using these protocols for centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting, particularly in network access control scenarios.

9. Access Management in Cloud and Mobile Environments
Cloud IAM: Managing identities and access control in cloud environments, addressing challenges such as multi-tenancy, dynamic scaling, and remote access.
Mobile Device Management (MDM): Securing mobile devices that access corporate resources through authentication, encryption, and policy enforcement.
